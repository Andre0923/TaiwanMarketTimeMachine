## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

> 💡 **`--default` 模式**：輸入 `--default` 等同於無額外指示，直接執行預設流程。

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty or `--default`).

---

## Operating Mode

This command supports **two operating modes** to balance interaction quality and API cost efficiency:

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Interactive** (Default) | No special flag | One question at a time with recommendations | Deep clarification, complex specs |
| **Batch** | `--batch` or 使用者說「批次模式」「多題問答」「一次問完」 | All questions presented at once | Cost-sensitive sessions, simple specs |

### Mode Detection Rules

**Use Batch Mode when** user input contains ANY of:
- `--batch` flag
- Keywords: 「批次模式」「多題問答」「一次問完」「batch」「all at once」

**Use Interactive Mode when**:
- No batch trigger detected (default)
- User explicitly says 「逐題模式」「interactive」「one by one」

---

## Outline

Goal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.

Note: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.

Execution steps:

1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -PathsOnly` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:
   - `FEATURE_DIR`
   - `FEATURE_SPEC`
   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)
   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).

   Functional Scope & Behavior:
   - Core user goals & success criteria
   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations
   - User roles / personas differentiation

   Domain & Data Model:
   - Entities, attributes, relationships
   - Identity & uniqueness rules
   - Lifecycle/state transitions
   - Data volume / scale assumptions

   Interaction & UX Flow:
   - Critical user journeys / sequences
   - Error/empty/loading states
   - Accessibility or localization notes

   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:
   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)
   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)
   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)
   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)
   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)
   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)

   Integration & External Dependencies:
   - External services/APIs and failure modes
   - Data import/export formats
   - Protocol/versioning assumptions

   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:
   - Negative scenarios
   - Rate limiting / throttling
   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)

   Constraints & Tradeoffs:
   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)
   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives

   Terminology & Consistency:
   - Canonical glossary terms
   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms

   Completion Signals:
   - Acceptance criteria testability
   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators

   Misc / Placeholders:
   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions
   - Ambiguous adjectives ("robust", "intuitive") lacking quantification

   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:
   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy
   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)

3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Apply these constraints:
    - Maximum of 5 total questions across the whole session.
    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:
       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR
       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: "Answer in <=5 words").
    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.
    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.
    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).
    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.
    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.

## Step 4: Questioning Flow (Mode-Dependent)

### 4A. Interactive Mode (Default)

Sequential questioning loop (interactive):
    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.
    - For multiple‑choice questions:
       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:
          - Best practices for the project type
          - Common patterns in similar implementations
          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)
          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec
       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).
       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`
       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:

       | Option | Description |
       |--------|-------------|
       | A | <Option A description> |
       | B | <Option B description> |
       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |
       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |

       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own short answer.`
    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):
       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.
       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`
       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying "yes" or "suggested", or provide your own answer.`
    - After the user answers:
       - If the user replies with "yes", "recommended", or "suggested", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.
       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.
       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).
       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.
    - Stop asking further questions when:
       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR
       - User signals completion ("done", "good", "no more"), OR
       - You reach 5 asked questions.
    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.
    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.

### 4B. Batch Mode (Cost-Efficient)

All-at-once questioning (single round):

1. **Present ALL questions in a single output** using this format:

   ```markdown
   ## 📋 Spec 釐清問題（批次模式）

   共有 **N** 個問題需要釐清。請依照下方格式一次回覆所有答案。

   ---

   ### Q1: [Question text]
   **類別**：[Taxonomy category]
   **影響**：[Brief impact description]

   **建議答案**：[Your recommended option/answer] — [1-2 sentence reasoning]

   | 選項 | 說明 |
   |------|------|
   | A | <Option A> |
   | B | <Option B> |
   | C | <Option C> |
   | 自訂 | 請提供簡短答案（≤5 字） |

   ---

   ### Q2: [Question text]
   ...（repeat for all questions）

   ---

   ## 📝 回覆格式

   請使用以下格式回覆（可直接複製修改）：

   ```
   Q1: [A/B/C/建議/自訂答案]
   Q2: [A/B/C/建議/自訂答案]
   Q3: [A/B/C/建議/自訂答案]
   ...
   ```

   💡 **快速回覆**：若全部接受建議答案，可直接回覆「全部採用建議」或「all recommended」。
   ```

2. **Processing user's batch response**:
   - Parse each line as `Q[N]: <answer>`
   - If user replies 「全部採用建議」/「all recommended」/「yes all」, use all recommended answers.
   - For each answer:
     - Map to option letter or validate short answer (<=5 words)
     - If any answer is ambiguous or invalid, list ONLY the problematic ones and ask for clarification (do not re-ask resolved ones)
   - Once all answers validated, proceed to integration (Step 5)

3. **Partial response handling**:
   - If user only answers some questions, accept those and ask: "您還有 N 個問題未回答，要繼續回答或跳過？"
   - If user says "跳過"/"skip remaining", proceed with answered questions only.

---

## Step 5: Integration

Integration after answers are accepted (approach varies by mode):

### Interactive Mode: Incremental Update
- Update spec file AFTER EACH accepted answer to minimize context loss risk.

### Batch Mode: Single Integration Pass
- Collect all validated answers first, then perform ONE integration pass.
- More efficient but slightly higher risk if session interrupted.

### Integration Rules (Both Modes):
    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.
    - For the first integrated answer in this session:
       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).
       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.
    - Append a bullet line for each answer: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.
    - Then apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):
       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.
       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.
       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.
       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).
       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).
       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as "X")` once.
    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.
    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.
    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).

6. Validation (performed after integration plus final pass):
   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).
   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.
   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.
   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).
   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.

7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.

8. **Git Checkpoint**: After all clarifications are integrated, execute `git add . && git commit -m "docs: 完成 Spec 釐清 [FEATURE_NAME]" && git push`.

9. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):
   - **Operating mode used** (Interactive / Batch).
   - Number of questions asked & answered.
   - Path to updated spec.
   - Sections touched (list names).
   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).
   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.
   - Suggested next command.

## Behavior Rules

### General Rules (Both Modes)

- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification." and suggest proceeding.
- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).
- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).
- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.
- Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed").
- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.
- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.

### Interactive Mode Specific

- Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.
- Never reveal future queued questions in advance.
- Save spec file after EACH integration to minimize context loss risk.

### Batch Mode Specific

- Present ALL questions (up to 5) in a single output.
- Allow user to answer all at once or partially.
- If fewer than 5 questions exist, output all available questions.
- Provide clear response format template for easy copy-paste.
- Accept "全部採用建議" / "all recommended" as shortcut for accepting all recommendations.
- Perform single integration pass after all answers validated.
